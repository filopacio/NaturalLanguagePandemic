# NaturalLanguagePandemic
My project work for the course 'Python for Analytics' at University of Bologna.

The projects analyses both singularly and generally the most popular sentiments and the most popular words on Twitter associated with Covid and Ebola pandemic events.

This is a mainly descriptive anaylysis which attempts to identify relevant patterns in terms of sentiments, emotions and use of keywords when a pandemic outbreak occurs.
